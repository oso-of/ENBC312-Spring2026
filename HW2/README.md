# Homework 2 - ENBC312

## Question 1
For this program, I used if then if else statements. I did a ` cout`  to prompt the user to enter a score and then used `cin`  so they can enter the score, also putting `int score` for score so the input is
classified as an integer. I then put a check case where if score was less or more than 100, it would be marked as invalid. Finally, I but if else statememts that categorized what score the user fell in and printed
that. All `couts` and `cins` used via `namespace std`.

## Question 2
I solved this question using three seperate parts. For part a, I wrote a for loop that started at `i=0` and iterated by 1 until 99 (so 100 times), the printed this file 
using cout and namespace std. For part b, I used a while loop by starting at 0 with int = 0 and then iterated by 1 until 99.The i++ was used outside the while loop instead, and cout
and namespace std were used. For part c I used a do while loop. Esentially, I used  the same format as part b but my while loop was put after, running after the do partt runs once.


## Question 3
For this program I developed a function that determines the most frequently occurring character in a string using an unordered_map. I implemented a hash table map where the counts of each
character were stored as the value, and the character itself was the key. I then looped through the string and incremented the count every time a character appeared. While doing this, I kept
track of the highest count and updated the result whenever a character’s frequency became greater than the current maximum. The function then returns the character with the highest frequency,
which is passed back to the main() function and printed.
